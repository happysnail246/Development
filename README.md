### Goal and Value of the Application
This is a bakery where you can add and remove items to cart

### Usability Principles Considered
there is an add and remove button for easy addition and removal

### Organization of Components
left side has the sorting and filtering aspects as well as the cart and total price
tight side is all the bakery items used from the react studio

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
i sort the bakery items based on the sorting criteria then filter it based on all the filters that are used

### How the User Triggers State Changes
the add/remove button triggers a state change 
the addition of a filter or a different sort by also trigger a state change
all of these rerender the page and the sorting takes place before the filtering
